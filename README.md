# BasicWeatherAPP created in Kotlin

Basic Weather app, that gets the users location permission, check network, then make a request to open weather api services.

This apps primary function is just teach how to use JSON, GSON, Retrofit in order to make api calls very easy.

I just use the get body from there and assing to various values that I display on the UI, ranging from temprature, condition to sun rise/set.
